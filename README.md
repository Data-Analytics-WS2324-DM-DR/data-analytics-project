## Release and establishment of the weevil Mecinus janthiniformis for biological control of Dalmatian toadflax in southern California

Group D

### For our project we have chosen a dataset about the release and establishment of the weevil Mecinus janthiniformis for biological control of Dalmatian toadflax in southern California. 

Dalmatian toadflax was introduced to North America in the 1800s, presumably as ornamental plants and for use in fabrics and folk remedies. The species is now widespread in large parts of the USA and Canada. A lack of natural enemies is seen as one reason why plant species become invasive pests when they are introduced into areas outside their original 
range. Due to its extensive root system and prolific seed production, it can thrive and spread rapidly in a variety of ecosystems, including grasslands and roadsides. 

Invasive plants such as Dalmatian toadflax can cause ecological problems. On the one hand, it can displace native plants and as a result reduce biodiversity. It can also have an impact on the availability of habitat for native animals as the dominance of Dalmatian toadflax can disrupt the strucutre and function of ecosystems. On the other hand, we have to think of the soil composition. Invasive plants can alter the soil by removing nutrients which can have an impact on the native vegetation. Moreover, Dalmatian toadflax can tend to accumulate dry material, which can increase fire hazard.

Therefore, attempts are being made to control the spread of Dalmatian toadflax. During the 1950s-1960s studies with herbicides have been conducted. Because of the variable responses, differenct herbicides have been recommended e.g. borate-chlorate mixtures, different acids or silvex. In addition, the use of adapted grasses in competition with toadflax was also investigated.
However, the studies concluded that chemical control alone is not practical for large infestations and emphasized the need for integrated control strategies that take into account both chemical and ecological factors.
Other studies have investigated the effect of prescribed fires on the spread of Dalmatian toadflax. However, these studies also concluded that fire does not reduce populations of Dalmatian toadflax.

Nowadays, biological control using herbivorous insects such as Mecinus janthiniformis is the most promising method of controlling invasive weeds in a long-term, cost-effective and sustainable way.
These insects can infest plants, seeds, roots, leaves and stems. Continuous effect and permanent control, as well as the good combination with other control methods and the self-spreading, but also long-term and environmentally friendly nature are just some of the advantages that should be mentioned.
However, studies and tests on the success of these natural control agents are very cost-intensive and time-consuming.
Nevertheless, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, which is why the use of herbivorous insects to control invasive plants is widespread today.

In our case, weevil Mecinus janthiniformis populations were released in the investigated area of southern California.
We aim to find patterns and trends within the dataset and define factors and potential predictors associated with the growth of Dalmatian toadflax and the spread of weevil populations.
