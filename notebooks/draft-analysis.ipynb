    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project we have chosen a dataset about the release and establishment of the weevil Mecinus janthiniformis for biological control of Dalmatian toadflax in southern California. Our motivation is to find patterns and trends within the data and define factors and potential predictors associated with the growth of Dalmatian toadflax and the spread of weevil populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dalmatian toadflax is an invasive plant that is considered an undesirable weed in southern California. It can thrive and spread rapidly in a variety of ecosystems, including grasslands and roadsides. Invasive plants such as Dalmatian toadflax can cause ecological problems. On the one hand, it can displace native plants and as a result reduce biodiversity. It can also have an impact on the availability of habitat for native animals as the dominance of Dalmatian toadflax can disrupt the strucutre and function of ecosystems. On the other hand, we have to think of the soil composition. Invasive plants can alter the soil by removing nutrients which can have an impact on the native vegetation. Moreover, Dalmatian toadflax can tend to accumulate dry material, which can increase fire hazard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, attempts are being made to control the spread of Dalmatian toadflax using weevil populations. They were released in the investigated area of southern California.\n",
    "\n",
    "General research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we identify predictors for forecasting plant size, in order to ascertain whether beetle cultivation impacts plant growth?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we plan to use linear regression to predict plant size, followed by logistic regression to determine whether a plant is affected by an infestation.\n",
    "- Which aspects can help predict the total main stem length?\n",
    "- Are plants that are infested by weevils really more likely to remain smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that the spread of weevil populations really contributes to the reduction of Dalmatian toadflax vegetation in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that beetle cultivation indeed influences the containment of spread, this could serve as a basis for deciding to use the beetles for controlling plant growth."

The ROC curve provides a visual way to observe changes in our model's classification thresholds that affect the model's performance. We plot the rate of true positives against the rate of false positives for all possible thresholds. This allows us to select the classification threshold at which we identify the most true-positive cases. "

    "The hypothesis that weevil populations contribute to the reduction of Dalmatian toadflax vegetation seems to be supported by the research questions. If plants infested by weevils are found to be more likely to remain smaller, this indicates a possible link between the presence of weevils and the suppression of Dalmatian toadflax growth. This result is consistent with the biological control strategy, which aims to reduce the impact of the invasive plant on the ecosystem.\n",
